Crafting New Sounds from Old Tools

# What is t.ŪI?
The Tūi project (*stylised: t.ŪI*) is a fledgling initiative where we get creative with old tech to make music education more accessible.
<br>
Drawing inspiration from the vocalizations and resourcefulness of the native Tūi bird, we take everyday items—like used wii remotes and outdated smartphones—into simple yet effective MIDI controllers. This DIY approach helps us navigate financial constraints and makes it possible for more students, especially those from less advantaged backgrounds, to experience the joy of digital music creation. This repository is a space where we will share our progress, ideas, and modifications. Whether you're curious about turning a DDR dance mat into a musical instrument or just want to see how old gadgets can find new life, join us as we tinker, experiment, and learn together.

# TUIs (Tangible User Interfaces) 
TUIs are novel forms of human-computer interactions based on the physical manipulation of everyday objects introduced by Hiroshi Ishii and Brygg Ullmer [1].
One of the most simple examples is the computer mouse - with its two *click*-parts and scroll wheel, a physical object used to interact with digital information.

By integrating MIDI control with accessible and intuitive design, TUIs can present advantages with respect to traditional approaches and methodologies is early music education. TUIs allow students to investigate basic music parameters, one by one or combining them in multiple ways. In addition TUIs serve as both simple and potent tools for exploring a range of concepts in sound and music computing.

# as MIDI controllers
As most TUIs function fundamentally as MIDI controllers, they provide an excellent platform for learning both the theoretical principles and practical rudiments of the MIDI protocol. Students can delve into more complex topics such as distributed musical performances, the dynamics of articulated MIDI chains, and the nuances of MIDI choking when using continuous controllers with fine granularity.
While TUIs primarily act as controllers, sound production is typically handled by a synthesizer, which can be manipulated through the TUI. This setup facilitates the exploration of various MIDI programs, including instrumental patches and sound banks, thereby promoting the study of sound synthesis models such as sampling and table lookup methods. Advanced topics, like SoundFont technology which employs sample-based synthesis to execute MIDI events, can also be covered.
TUIs also prompt detailed technical discussions on issues such as resolving MIDI choking, navigating MIDI-over-Bluetooth bandwidth limitations, and evaluating the performance of pressure sensors that detect subtle variations and endure significant stress. These discussions are particularly relevant for students with a background in both music and technology.

# From a pedagogical standpoint
TUI-based activities can be effectively incorporated within the Think-Make-Improve model [2]. For instance, by recording students' performances via a MIDI sequencer connected to a TUI and encouraging them to reflect on their actions, educators can foster a deeper understanding and continuous improvement in their students’ musical and technical skills.

<summary>Exploring Music Fundamentals with TUIs</summary>
  <br>
  Tangible User Interfaces (TUIs) offer a fresh approach to early music education by allowing students to delve into basic musical elements both individually and in combination. For example, TUIs set to keyboard-like modes enable exploration of melody—pitch, intensity, and scale models—and timbre. In percussion-like modes, students can develop rhythm awareness, learning about tempo, note lengths, and accents. Additionally, using multiple tangible parameters simultaneously helps learners grasp harmonic concepts.

<summary>Customizable Learning Experiences</summary>
  <br>
  The flexibility of software applications used in TUIs allows for custom experiences tailored to specific educational needs. For instance, many early childhood music methodologies, like Orff, Kodaly, and Waldorf, emphasize learning with a pentatonic scale. TUIs can easily adapt to these needs, starting with the pentatonic scale and later transitioning to major and minor scales. For younger children, especially those in preschool or early primary school, TUIs can also introduce alternative musical notations. Recognizable shapes or colors can represent different musical pitches or elements, aiding children who cannot yet read or those with cognitive challenges.

<summary>Developing Computational Thinking through Music</summary>
  <br>
  TUIs also promote computational thinking by establishing clear patterns and associations between shapes, positions, and musical meanings. These associations help learners understand musical structures and develop abstraction skills. For example, when using TUIs in a keyboard mode set to the C-major scale, changing the sequence of tangibles to represent different intervals (like a third or a fifth) helps users learn about harmonic structures and interval relationships. This setup can be adjusted over time to introduce new musical intervals and concepts, encouraging both individual learning and collaborative exploration.
